"Let us dream of tomorrow where we can truly love from the soul, and know love as the ultimate truth at the heart of all creation."
It is always the simple that produces the marvelous.
"Just don't give up trying to do what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I don't think you can go wrong."
"If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door."
"Clouds come floating into my life, no longer to carry rain or usher storm, but to add color to my sunset sky."
"If you believe in yourself and have dedication and pride - and never quit, you'll be a winner. The price of victory is high but so are the rewards."
"If you always put limit on everything you do, physical or anything else. It will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them."
Keep your face always toward the sunshine - and shadows will fall behind you.
"When the sun is shining I can do anything; no mountain is too high, no trouble too difficult to overcome."
"What lies behind you and what lies in front of you, pales in comparison to what lies inside of you."
"Thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared."
God always gives His best to those who leave the choice with him.
Tears of joy are like the summer rain drops pierced by sunbeams.
"Let us remember: One book, one pen, one child, and one teacher can change the world."
"Even if I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces, I would still plant my apple tree."
Out of difficulties grow miracles.
Don't let the fear of striking out hold you back.
Your big opportunity may be right where you are now.
Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.
"I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars."
"No matter what people tell you, words and ideas can change the world."
With self-discipline most anything is possible.
"Happiness resides not in possessions, and not in gold, happiness dwells in the soul."
Everyone here has the sense that right now is one of those moments when we are influencing the future.
Let your life lightly dance on the edges of Time like dew on the tip of a leaf.
"When you get into a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hang on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn."
"People tell you the world looks a certain way. Parents tell you how to think. Schools tell you how to think. TV. Religion. And then at a certain point, if you're lucky, you realize you can make up your own mind. Nobody sets the rules but you. You can design your own life."
To love means loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Faith means believing the unbelievable. Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless.
